# ASCS
A statistical approach of analysis of synonymous codon signatures (ASCS) that maps codon-biased onto a functional network of gene categories.
These scripts are used to find codon bias genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S288C strain) using binomial distribution and map the codon bias genes onto their functional network using canonical correlation analysis (CCA).
